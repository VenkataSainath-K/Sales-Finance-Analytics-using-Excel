Sales &amp; Finance Analytics using Excel

In this project, I crafted a user-friendly sales report using Excel. This report helps businesses figure out the best discounts for their customers, simplifies negotiations, and pinpoints potential locations for expanding their operations. The reports provide practical insights and recommendations to refine sales strategies, boost customer satisfaction, and increase revenue.

Throughout the project, I acquired expertise on following

➡ Pivot Tables

➡ Power Query

➡ DAX

➡ Conditional Formatting

➡ Report Beautification

➡ Sales domain metrics

The project's main objective is to empower businesses with the necessary tools and insights to monitor, evaluate and enhance their sales activities. By leveraging sales data analysis, businesses can unlock new opportunities for growth in a competitive market.

Key Takeaways:

➡ Enhanced sales performance monitoring

➡ Data-driven customer discount optimization

➡ Strategic expansion opportunities

➡ User-friendly sales report
